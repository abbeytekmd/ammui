is it possible to have a media browser view button that chnages the view from a list to a grid of larger thumbnails

show the view button for pictures and the play all / queue all button for music tracks

when looking at anything apart from pictures, go to list view 

remove the view button and just go into grid mode in picture folders, list mode in all other folders

remove the dividers from the play all / queue all button bar apart from the one to the left of the Set buttons

if we view a panorama photo, can we view it in a better way

the view grid doesn't look great in mobile mode

can we add a fiolder button to the slideshow that will take us to the folder where the picture was tken from in tile mode

actually, don't add it as a button, just go to the folder when you click on the folder that's displayed on teh left
